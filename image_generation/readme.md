## Core Principles

### 1. **Specificity Over Generality**
- Vague: "a nice portrait"
- Better: "hyper-realistic studio portrait with professional lighting"

### 2. **Visual Hierarchy**
- Start with the main subject
- Add environment/background
- Specify lighting and mood
- Include technical details

### 3. **Professional Photography Language**
- Use camera terminology (85mm lens, f/1.4, shallow depth of field)
- Reference lighting setups (Rembrandt lighting, studio lighting)
- Mention photography styles (editorial, cinematic, fine art)

## Anatomy of Effective Prompts

A well-structured prompt typically includes:
1. **Subject Description** (who/what)
2. **Pose/Action** (body language, positioning)
3. **Environment** (background, setting)
4. **Lighting** (type, direction, mood)
5. **Style** (aesthetic, genre)
6. **Technical Specifications** (camera settings, composition)
7. **Mood/Atmosphere** (emotional tone)

## üîπ Example 1: Professional Branding Portrait

**Prompt Used:**

<div style="width: 200px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
Hyper-realistic full-body portrait of the uploaded photo, standing casually against a smooth light-gray wall. The outfit is as worn as in winter. The hands are inside the pockets, the left hand wears a square smartwatch, one leg casually crossed over the other, relaxed and confident posture. The lighting is a professional studio, bright yet soft, premium clarity.

On the wall beside him is a bold black-and-white stylized vector portrait of the same subject, rendered with modern geometric accents. Beneath the graphic, add clean bold text 'Zia Khan' in large type, and below it is a smaller font 'Agentic AI Developer'

Mood & Style: modern, minimalistic, premium personal-branding aesthetic, sharp contrast, sleek composition.

‚úÖ **What Worked Here**

* **Subject grounding**: ‚Äúof the uploaded photo‚Äù ensures consistency.
* **Pose instructions**: ‚Äúhands inside the pockets, leg casually crossed‚Äù avoids random posture.
* **Context & setting**: ‚Äúsmooth light-gray wall, professional studio lighting‚Äù makes it brand-safe.
* **Extra elements**: vector portrait + typography = personal brand identity.

üí° **Takeaway Rule:** *For branding prompts, combine subject grounding + posture + context + design elements (like logos or text).*

## Camera Equipment & Technical Specifications

### Lenses & Focal Lengths

**Portrait Lenses (85mm-135mm)**
- **85mm lens**: The gold standard for portraits; provides natural perspective with subtle compression
- **105mm lens**: Slightly more compressed than 85mm; excellent for isolating subjects
- **135mm lens**: Maximum compression for dramatic effect; requires more distance from subject

**Standard Lenses (35mm-50mm)**
- **50mm lens**: "Normal" lens that mimics human vision; versatile for environmental portraits
- **35mm lens**: Wider field of view; good for environmental storytelling and context

**Wide Angle Lenses (14mm-35mm)**
- **24mm lens**: Wide perspective; can create dramatic environmental context
- **35mm lens**: Moderate wide angle; includes more environment without distortion

### Aperture Settings (f-stops)

**Wide Apertures (Shallow Depth of Field)**
- **f/1.4**: Maximum background blur (bokeh); extremely shallow focus
- **f/1.8**: Strong subject isolation; creamy background separation
- **f/2.8**: Good separation while maintaining some background context

**Medium Apertures (Balanced Focus)**
- **f/4.0**: Moderate depth of field; good for environmental portraits
- **f/5.6**: Standard portrait aperture; sharp subject with blurred background

## Lighting Terminology

### Studio Lighting Setup

**Key Light**
- Primary light source illuminating the subject
- Usually positioned 45 degrees from camera axis
- Determines the overall exposure and main shadows

**Fill Light**
- Secondary light that reduces shadow contrast
- Typically softer and less intense than key light
- Positioned opposite the key light

**Rim Light/Hair Light**
- Back light that creates separation from background
- Highlights the edge/outline of the subject
- Creates depth and dimensionality

**Background Light**
- Illuminates the backdrop separately from subject
- Controls background tone and separation
- Can create gradients or even illumination

### Lighting Patterns

**Rembrandt Lighting**
- Classic portrait lighting creating small triangle of light on shadow side of face
- Key light positioned high and to one side
- Creates dramatic, artistic mood

**Butterfly Lighting**
- Light directly in front and above subject
- Creates butterfly-shaped shadow under nose
- Flattering for most face shapes

**Split Lighting**
- Light positioned 90 degrees to side of subject
- Half the face in light, half in shadow
- Creates dramatic, moody effect

**Loop Lighting**
- Slight variation of Rembrandt with softer shadows
- Small shadow loop from nose on cheek
- Natural, flattering look

### Light Quality Descriptions

**Hard Light**
- Direct, undiffused light source
- Creates sharp, defined shadows
- High contrast between highlights and shadows
- Example: Direct sunlight, bare flash

**Soft Light**
- Diffused or bounced light source
- Gradual transition between light and shadow
- Even, flattering illumination
- Example: Overcast sky, softbox, umbrella

**Directional Light**
- Light with clear direction creating modeling
- Reveals form and texture through shadows
- Creates three-dimensional appearance

**Flat Light**
- Even illumination with minimal shadows
- Reduces texture and dimension
- Good for eliminating imperfections

---

## Natural Lighting Conditions

### Time-Based Lighting

**Golden Hour**
- First/last hour of sunlight
- Warm, soft, directional light
- Long shadows and golden color temperature
- Most flattering natural light for portraits

**Blue Hour**
- Period just after sunset/before sunrise
- Even, soft blue-toned light
- No harsh shadows
- Romantic, moody atmosphere

**Overcast**
- Cloudy sky acting as giant softbox
- Even, diffused lighting
- No harsh shadows
- Consistent light throughout day

**Midday Sun**
- Direct overhead sunlight
- Hard, unflattering shadows under eyes and nose
- High contrast
- Generally avoided for portraits

### Direction & Quality

**Window Light**
- Soft, directional natural light
- Size of window affects light quality
- North-facing windows provide consistent light
- Can be modified with curtains or diffusion

**Backlighting**
- Subject between camera and light source
- Creates rim lighting effect
- Can produce lens flare or silhouettes
- Dramatic and atmospheric

**Side Lighting**
- Light coming from subject's side
- Reveals texture and form
- Creates natural shadow patterns
- Good for dramatic portraits

---

## Depth of Field Terminology

### Focus Effects

**Shallow Depth of Field**
- Small area in sharp focus
- Background/foreground heavily blurred
- Created by wide apertures (f/1.4, f/1.8)
- Isolates subject from environment

**Deep Depth of Field**
- Large area in sharp focus
- Background remains recognizable
- Created by narrow apertures (f/8, f/11)
- Good for environmental context

**Bokeh**
- Quality of out-of-focus areas
- Smooth, creamy blur is desirable
- Affected by lens design and aperture shape
- "Good bokeh" = pleasing background blur

**Focus Fall-off**
- Gradual transition from sharp to blurred
- Rate depends on aperture and focal length
- Longer lenses create faster fall-off

---

## Composition & Framing

### Classic Rules

**Rule of Thirds**
- Frame divided into nine equal sections
- Subject positioned at intersection points
- Creates more dynamic composition than centering

**Leading Lines**
- Lines in image that draw eye to subject
- Can be architectural elements, natural features
- Creates depth and guides viewer attention

**Negative Space**
- Empty areas around subject
- Provides breathing room in composition
- Can be used for text overlay in branding

**Framing**
- Using elements to create border around subject
- Windows, doorways, natural elements
- Draws attention to subject

### Portrait-Specific Framing

**Headshot**
- Cropped at shoulders or upper chest
- Focus on face and expression
- Standard for corporate and acting portfolios

**Three-Quarter Length**
- Cropped at mid-thigh or knee
- Shows more body language and pose
- Good balance of subject and environment

**Full-Body**
