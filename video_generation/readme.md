# Video Generation Tutorial for Google Veo 3

*By Example – with Real Prompts*

Access at https://gemini.google/overview/video-generation/ or via [Gemini AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat)

Google Veo 3 (like Runway ML, Pika Labs, or Stable Video Diffusion) responds to highly descriptive, cinematic prompts. The more structured, visual, and contextual your input, the closer the output matches your creative vision. Veo 3 delivers best-in-class quality, excelling in physics, realism, and prompt adherence, while also generating synchronized audio including sound effects, ambient noise, and dialogue natively.

Note: This is bonus material, due to high cost of the model **this tutor in not covered in the Panaversity Certification Exams**:

## Core Principles

### 1. **Cinematic Specificity Over Generic Descriptions**
- Vague: "a person walking"
- Better: "Medium shot of a woman in flowing red dress walking through misty forest at golden hour, camera tracking left to right"

### 2. **Narrative Structure**
- Start with camera movement/angle
- Define the subject and action
- Add environment and atmosphere
- Specify audio elements
- Include technical cinematography details

### 3. **Professional Film Language**
- Use camera terminology (close-up, wide shot, tracking shot, dolly zoom)
- Reference lighting setups (key lighting, rim lighting, natural window light)
- Mention film styles (cinematic, documentary, noir, vintage film grain)

## Anatomy of Effective Veo 3 Prompts

A well-structured prompt typically includes:
1. **Camera Movement/Angle** (establishing the shot)
2. **Subject Description** (who/what is in frame)
3. **Action/Movement** (what's happening)
4. **Environment/Setting** (where it takes place)
5. **Lighting/Atmosphere** (mood and visual tone)
6. **Audio Elements** (dialogue, sound effects, ambient)
7. **Technical Style** (film format, color grading)
8. **Duration Pacing** (how action unfolds over time)

## 🎬 Example 1: Corporate Brand Video

**Prompt Used:**

<div style="width: 200px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
Wide establishing shot slowly pushing in to medium close-up of a confident business professional in a modern glass office. Subject walks purposefully toward floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a city skyline. Wearing sharp navy suit, hands clasped behind back, slight head turn toward camera with determined expression. Golden hour lighting streams through windows creating dramatic rim lighting. Ambient sound of distant city traffic, subtle footsteps on polished floor. "This is where innovation begins," spoken with conviction. Cinematic color grading with warm highlights and cool shadows. Shot on RED camera with shallow depth of field.
</div>

**Generated Video Characteristics:**
- 8-second duration with smooth camera movement
- Professional lighting with realistic physics
- Synchronized lip movement with dialogue
- Environmental audio layers (city ambiance + footsteps)

✅ **What Worked Here**

* **Camera direction**: "Wide establishing shot slowly pushing in" creates professional movement.
* **Subject grounding**: Specific wardrobe and positioning details ensure consistency.
* **Environmental storytelling**: Office setting + skyline = corporate success narrative.
* **Audio layering**: Dialogue + ambient sound + foley effects = immersive experience.

💡 **Takeaway Rule:** *For corporate videos, combine camera movement + professional setting + confident subject + layered audio for maximum impact.*

## 🎬 Example 2: Cinematic Character Portrait

**Prompt Used:**

<div style="width: 200px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
Extreme close-up of weathered hands lighting a cigarette in dim noir lighting. Camera slowly pulls back to reveal a mysterious figure in a fedora sitting in a shadowy alley. Rain glistens on wet cobblestones, neon signs reflecting in puddles. The figure takes a slow drag, exhales smoke that drifts across frame. Sound of distant rain pattering, match striking, deep exhale. No dialogue, just atmospheric tension. Black and white with high contrast, film noir aesthetic. Shot on 35mm film with natural grain texture.
</div>

**Style Elements:**
- Noir cinematography with dramatic shadows
- Environmental storytelling through setting
- Atmospheric audio design
- Classic film emulation with grain

✅ **What Worked Here**

* **Progressive reveal**: Starting with hands, then revealing character creates intrigue.
* **Atmospheric audio**: Rain + match + exhale builds immersive soundscape.
* **Visual style consistency**: Film noir aesthetic maintained throughout.
* **Pacing control**: Slow, deliberate movements match the moody tone.

💡 **Takeaway Rule:** *For artistic videos, layer environmental details + atmospheric audio + consistent visual style for compelling storytelling.*

## 🎬 Example 3: Product Showcase

**Prompt:**

<div style="width: 200px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
Macro lens extreme close-up of sleek smartphone rotating slowly on white seamless background. Camera orbits the device revealing premium materials and precise engineering details. Soft studio lighting with subtle reflections on glass screen. Clean, minimal aesthetic with shallow depth of field. Subtle electronic music building gradually. No dialogue, focus on visual elegance. Color grading emphasizes cool blues and warm metallic tones. Shot with high-end macro lens, crystal clear detail.
</div>

✅ **Why This Works:**
Creates premium product presentation with professional studio quality and synchronized music.

# 🎯 Best Practices for Prompt Engineering in Veo 3

## 1. **Structure Your Narrative**

Aim for a balanced range of roughly 3–6 sentences, or 100–150 words. This gives you room to describe the subject, context, action, and style, with optional space for camera, ambiance, or sound.

## 2. **Layer Your Audio Design**

With Veo 3, you can provide cues for sound effects, ambient noise, and dialogue. Use quotes for specific speech and explicitly describe sound effects.

* **Dialogue**: Use quotation marks for specific speech
* **Sound Effects**: Explicitly describe (footsteps, door closing, wind)  
* **Ambient Audio**: Environmental sounds (city traffic, ocean waves, forest sounds)
* **Music**: Background music style and mood

## 3. **Control Camera Movement**

* **Static shots**: "Camera holds steady," "Fixed frame"
* **Movement**: "Slow push in," "Camera pulls back," "Tracking shot left to right"
* **Handheld**: "Handheld documentary style," "Organic camera movement"
* **Cinematic**: "Smooth dolly movement," "Crane shot descending"

## 4. **Specify Visual Style**

* **Lighting**: Natural window light, golden hour, studio lighting, noir shadows
* **Color**: Warm/cool tones, high contrast, desaturated, vintage film look
* **Format**: 35mm film grain, digital cinema, mobile vertical, documentary style

## 5. **Plan for 8-Second Duration**

Understanding the model's current limitations like the 8-second clip length are essential for efficient workflow. Think carefully about your prompts and generate only one output at a time, as each generation takes 2-3 minutes or more.

* **Single action/movement** works best
* **Avoid complex scene changes** within one clip
* **Focus on one key moment** rather than full narratives

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. **Sequential Storytelling**
Veo3 works well with 'this then that'. You can direct a chain of different emotions or physical actions within a single prompt, allowing for complex emotional arcs in a short time.

<div style="width: 200px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
Subject starts looking down pensively, then slowly lifts head with growing confidence, finally smiling directly at camera with determination.
</div>

### 2. **Cinematic Camera Language**
<div style="width: 200px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
Opening: Wide establishing shot of location
Middle: Medium shot showing character interaction  
Close: Extreme close-up revealing emotional detail
Movement: Smooth dolly push-in for intensity
</div>

### 3. **Professional Lighting Setups**
<div style="width: 200px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
Key light: Main illumination from camera left
Fill light: Soft bounce light reducing harsh shadows
Rim light: Backlight creating subject separation
Practical lights: In-scene light sources (lamps, windows, neon)
</div>

### 4. **Audio-Visual Synchronization**
<div style="width: 200px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
Visual: Character's mouth opens in surprise
Audio: Sharp intake of breath, background music swells
SFX: Door slamming in distance
Dialogue: "I can't believe this is happening"
</div>
